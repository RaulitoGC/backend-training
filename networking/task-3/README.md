# Network Health Dashboard - Task 3 Evaluation

## Task Overview

Create a web dashboard showing network statistics including:

- Public IP address
- Router's DNS resolution
- Private IP range (RFC 1918)
- Connected devices
- Uptime monitoring

## Implementation Approach

The solution uses:

- Express.js for the web interface
- Server-Sent Events for auto-refresh
- Integration with previous task's device discovery
- Real-time network monitoring

## Follow-up Questions Evaluation

### 1. How to detect ISP changes? (Score: 15/20)

**Your Response:**

> If ISP change its public IP address, we can storage the last ip address used and each time we emit an event, we can compare if it changes with the latest one or not.

**Analysis:**

- ✅ Correct basic approach of comparing IP addresses
- ✅ Good use of event-driven architecture
- ❌ Missing consideration of:
  - IP change frequency monitoring
  - Historical IP tracking
  - ISP identification methods
  - Network interface monitoring
  - Connection type detection

**Knowledge Gaps:**

- Network interface monitoring techniques
- ISP identification protocols
- IP change detection best practices
- Network event handling

### 2. What DNS alternatives exist for home networks? (Score: 12/20)

**Your Response:**

> Usually, DNS is the table to map host name to ip address. in the case of home, it usually uses the DNS of the router. But we can add more DNS server to map correspondent host names. We can use nodeJS to create dns server and add customization to it. We can also add more DNS server in our wifi or ethernet configurations

**Analysis:**

- ✅ Basic understanding of DNS functionality
- ✅ Correct about router DNS usage
- ✅ Good mention of custom DNS server possibility
- ❌ Missing important alternatives:
  - Pi-hole
  - Unbound
  - AdGuard Home
  - DNS-over-HTTPS
  - DNS-over-TLS
  - Split DNS configurations

**Knowledge Gaps:**

- Modern DNS protocols
- DNS security features
- DNS caching strategies
- DNS privacy solutions
- DNS performance optimization

### 3. How to secure this dashboard? (Score: 14/20)

**Your Response:**

> There are multiple ways, but some of then are that we can only allow MAC addresses that we know. We can only be access from local network ips

**Analysis:**

- ✅ Good basic security approach with MAC filtering
- ✅ Correct about local network restriction
- ❌ Missing important security measures:
  - Authentication mechanisms
  - HTTPS implementation
  - Rate limiting
  - Input validation
  - Session management
  - Security headers
  - API key implementation

**Knowledge Gaps:**

- Web security best practices
- Authentication methods
- Network security protocols
- API security
- Session management
- Security headers and configurations

4. Implement proper error handling and logging
5. Add user authentication and authorization
6. Implement HTTPS
7. Add rate limiting and request validation
8. Implement proper session management
